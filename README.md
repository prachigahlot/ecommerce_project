If directory listing persists, disable it:
Open httpd.conf (Apache Config).
Search for:
mathematica

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
Change it to:
mathematica

Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
Restart Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel.
Issue: PHP Code is Displayed as Text
Ensure PHP is installed and enabled.
Verify Apache and MySQL are running.
Create a test.php file with:
php

<?php
echo "PHP is working!";
?>
Visit: http://localhost/ecommerce_project/test.php to confirm.
